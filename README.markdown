# Vagrant for Jenkins

This plugin is still in its very early stages of development. The "workflow" or
the plugin is conceptually modelled after the [Android Emulator
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin)
maintained by [Christopher Orr](https://github.com/orrc).
